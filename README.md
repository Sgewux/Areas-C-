# Areas-C-
A short program in C++ where you can see an example of inheritance and polymorphism

## How to run it
To run the program you just have to clone the repo, then you gotta have a compiler, in my case i used g++ compiler, just compile the main.cpp file and then run it. Also you can open it with your favorite IDE, i used codeblocks and vs code, there you can build and run the program.
